    ''' NavigationHelper aids in navigation between pages.  It provides commands used to 
    ''' navigate back and forward as well as registers for standard mouse and keyboard 
    ''' shortcuts used to go back and forward in Windows and the hardware back button in
    ''' Windows Phone.  In addition it integrates SuspensionManger to handle process lifetime
    ''' management and state management when navigating between pages.
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <remarks>
    ''' <example>
    ''' To make use of NavigationHelper, follow these two steps or
    ''' start with a BasicPage or any other Page item template other than BlankPage.
    ''' 
    ''' 1) Create an instance of the NaivgationHelper somewhere such as in the 
    '''     constructor for the page and register a callback for the LoadState and 
    '''     SaveState events.
    ''' <code>
    '''     Public NotInheritable Class MyPage
    '''         Inherits Page
    ''' 
    '''         Public Sub New()
    '''             InitializeComponent();
    '''             Me._navigationHelper = New Common.NavigationHelper(Me)
    '''             AddHandler Me._navigationHelper.LoadState, AddressOf NavigationHelper_LoadState
    '''             AddHandler Me._navigationHelper.SaveState, AddressOf NavigationHelper_SaveState
    '''         End Sub
    '''     
    '''     Private Sub NavigationHelper_LoadState(sender As Object, e As Common.LoadStateEventArgs)
    '''     End Sub
    ''' 
    '''     Private Sub NavigationHelper_SaveState(sender As Object, e As Common.SaveStateEventArgs)
    '''     End Sub
    ''' </code>
    ''' 
    ''' 2) Register the page to call into the NavigationHelper whenever the page participates 
    '''     in navigation by overriding the <see cref="Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Page.OnNavigatedTo"/> 
    '''     and <see cref="Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Page.OnNavigatedFrom"/> events.
    ''' <code>
    '''     Protected Overrides Sub OnNavigatedTo(e As NavigationEventArgs)
    '''         _navigationHelper.OnNavigatedTo(e)
    '''     
    '''     Protected Overrides Sub OnNavigatedFrom(e As NavigationEventArgs)
    '''         _navigationHelper.OnNavigatedFrom(e)
    ''' </code>
